        "because of this, the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador's neighborhoods the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces.",
        "bustillo's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador, as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november.",
        "for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice.",
        "this first happened in the interior of the country, with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo, berlin, torola, san fernando, and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto, sunpul, and ocotapayo.",
        "bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have.",
        "and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador.",
        "as all the others who have left, bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure, by accusing others.",
        "he accuses (former defense minister eugenio) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people's plan.",
        "one would have to ask bustillo if the air force, of which he represented its most encouraging pillar, was soft when it murdered 70,000 salvadorans, monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included, and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army.",
        "was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $3 billion, weapons, and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century?",
        "the u.s. strategy, implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country's vital centers, as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive.",
        "bustillo states it clearly.",
        "the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command.",
        "through an act of genocide, it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were.",
        "bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive.",
        "bustillo acknowledges the fmln's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict.",
        "a political solution would express the consensus among the country's major sectors.",
        "obviously the top command represents a decadent minority.",
        "bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people's wish for democracy.",
        "in this effort, he lashes out at the catholic church, all opposition sectors that report human rights violations, and all sectors that support democratizing the country.",
        "in conclusion, we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition.",
        "the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia, vides, and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states: to stop the fmln.",
        "the fmln offensive bared the genocidal, antipopular, and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid.",
        "the jesuits' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents.",
        "however, the bush administration accepted this, since colonel rene emilio ponce (chairman of the joints chiefs of staff) and his clique, even cristiani, must shoulder this responsibility.",
        "we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings.",
        "bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid.",
        "bustillo is bush's scapegoat.",
        "however, bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active.",
        "will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy?",
        "time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador.",
        "while peoples of the world tear down dogmas, dictatorships, and walls, bustillo, who leaves through the door of defeat, asks the armed forces to be tougher, commit more genocide, and build more walls of repression against the church, the people, and the nation as a whole.",
        "goodbye, gen. bustillo.",
        "we continue writing history without you.",
        "the decade we begin is of democracy, independence, and self-determination.",
        "that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country, where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings."

        "the government strongly condemns this kind of action--the murder of (retired) general gustavo alvarez martinez--which was politically motivated and perpetrated by professionals, and which, i believe, deserves the denunciation of all hondurans.",
        "(valdes) mr president, will the three branches of government and the armed forces adopt additional security measures?",
        "(azcona) yes, we will be discussing that soon.",

        "we have also invited the candidates of the two (number as heard) parties to this meeting since one of them is going to be the next honduran president.",
        "we plan to establish some guideline--some rules to be followed--not just for the remainder of our term but in the future as well, because we should be farsighted and not just concentrate on the short term, which has been very common in honduras, where we look and find solutions only for the present.",
        "we should find solutions jointly (words indistinct) in the long run, which includes the issue of violence.",
        "we believe in a democracy like ours, which is a very complete democracy.",
        "in other words, there are internal elections for selecting candidates, where citizens enjoy full rights, where parties and party leaders consult with the people, where we have true, clean, and honest elections, where we have a national electoral commission that is not influenced by nor can it be influenced by the government, and where the state branches are totally independent.",
        "all of these characteristics make honduras a democracy, and every sector of honduran society should strive to strengthen them by avoiding violence at all costs, obeying the law, and condemning and attacking extreme terrorist groups regardless of their affiliation, thus enabling us to consolidate our democracy and reach the level of political development attained by other democratic countries.",
        "it has been demonstrated worldwide that progress and development can only be achieved through democracy.",
        "the frg, the mediterranean countries--italy, france, and spain--are examples of this, and there is the case of japan, which has a liberal democratic system and has achieved extraordinary levels of development.",

        "(azcona) yes.",
        "at this stage i believe there is sufficient proof that the democratic system is the best means of attaining higher levels of development.",
        "there is no doubt in anyone's mind about that, but the fact that we have this system is not enough.",
        "each one of us, each sector, must do his part to make it work.",
        "when i mention sectors, i am referring to private enterprise, which must be generous, exhibit confidence in the country, and show much initiative; to organized labor groups, which must fight for their rights without fomenting strikes and other disorders, which are sometimes brought about illegally instead of following the normal legal procedures; to professional associations, which also have an enormous responsibility, because their members must comply with their duties; and the same goes for government employees and others.",
        "in other words, this will not be accomplished by this or the next government alone.",
        "our governments are transitory and their power is relative.",
        "i have said this many times.",

        "this should be a responsibility not only of public employees, businessmen, workers, and organized peasants, but all hondurans should contribute.",
        "that is what counts.",
        "(valdes) mr president, when will this meeting be held and what immediate measures will you propose?",
        "(azcona) the appropriate authorities are doing everything possible to investigate the latest crime, which was not an everyday occurrence like a robbery or something of that nature.",
        "this crime was carefully planned.",
        "it was a terrorist act perpetrated by professionals.",
        "(valdes) mr president, some people have been saying that the death penalty might be a way to cope with the situation.",
        "what do you think about this?",
        "(azcona) i recently read something about the death penalty in a mexican magazine.",
        "the death penalty is opposed by a majority of the people and has been abolished in honduras.",
        "i do not think this is the solution here because the death penalty has not solved the crime problem anywhere else in the world.",
        "for instance, this penalty exists in many u.s. states, but this has not deterred criminals from committing terrible crimes.",
        "people have lost control.",
        "when criminals have no respect for their fellow man, not even the death penalty can stop them.",
        "however, there are crimes, such as drug trafficking, for which no bail should be permitted.",
        "i think a bill that has been proposed by the supreme court of justice should be passed by the congress.",
        "of course, it will be approved by the president so those found guilty of this crime cannot be bailed out.",
        "it is not right for the authorities to arrest a drug trafficker only to see him released on bail by a judge who has no other choice than to abide by the law.",
        "(valdes) mr president, the far rightist group aaa (anticommunist action alliance), through a local radio station, warned that they will take revenge on major communist leaders, such as jorge arturo reina, ramon custodio, and others.",
        "what do you have to say about this?",
        "(azcona) i am adamantly opposed to this type of revenge because it would only lead to escalated confrontations between groups.",
        "i condemn this attitude in view of the regrettable murder of general gustavo alvarez martinez.",
        "as far as the death penalty goes, it will not be a solution to the crime problem.",
        "(valdes) mr president, civic committees have to be organized in the country.",
        "(azcona) i agree, but these committees should be controlled by the authorities.",
        "a civic committee to protect communities is one thing, but it is quite another thing to sue these committees to perform duties that are already the responsibility of state agencies, such as the armed forces.",
        "(valdes) when will the government branches meet?",
        "(azcona) they will meet when i return from caracas."

        "accordingly, the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones, namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states.",

        "however, political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties -- the liberals and the conservatives, who maintain a merely formal democracy.",
        "we should not forget colombia's strategic position: it forms a bridge between central and south america.",
        "all events in colombia affect the neighboring countries.",
        "precisely because of this, the so-called \"santa fe-2\" document, drawn up by extreme right-wing u.s. politicians, contains a plan to apply pressure in colombia and, more specifically, to expand the so-called low-intensity conflict, one of whose manifestations is the so-called \"dirty war\" in the country.",
        "accordingly, the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones, namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states.",
        "(sertov) can one expect the peace settlement to be fulfilled under these conditions?",
        "(cepeda) this is the aim of the communist party of colombia (pcc).",
        "at our recent 15th congress, we made a detailed analysis of the situation and concluded that the conflict in colombia must be settled by political means.",
        "the pcc raised the question of removing the siege situation that, with a few interruptions, has been maintained for several decades, and of disbanding the paramilitary groups (according to the minister of internal affairs, about 140 such groups are operating).",
        "these groups owe their very existence to the support given by military circles and the clan chiefs to the trade in narcotics.",
        "(i will add in parentheses that this is the reason for the use of the term \"narcomilitarism\" in colombia.)",
        "one of the pcc's demands is that the army should be purged of fascist elements and that a civilian should be put in charge of the ministry of defense.",
        "the party also raised the question of making a start on the necessary democratic reforms, but the government pays no heed to our demands.",
        "the government recently reached an agreement with \"m-19,\" one of the partisan groupings in the country, but did not accept any commitments in practice.",
        "accordingly, there are some doubts over how the lives of the partisan leaders will be subsequently guaranteed.",
        "the largest partisan group -- the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -- is demanding that the government take serious steps to limit the paramilitary groups, in order to conclude a truce.",
        "(sertov) clearly, it will not be easy to achieve peace in colombia.",
        "(cepeda) at the moment, peace supporters in colombia are forming a broad front, which in practice has an antifascist orientation.",
        "peace depends on how far this front will succeed in expanding, how the contradictions within the government itself regarding the paramilitary groups will deepen, and on whether we will succeed in isolating them.",
        "we are optimists, but also have a great need of international solidarity.",
        "(sertov) how do you assess the political prospects for the united left in your country?",
        "(cepeda) the left forces in colombia are united in the patriotic union that was created 4 years ago.",

        "threats continue to be made against the union and against the pcc.",
        "all members of the pcc leadership have received death threats.",

        "his wife and comrades sotelo and sotomayor also died in the atrocity.",
        "next day, we had a meeting with virgilio barco, president of colombia.",
        "he promises to take speedy measures against the paramilitary groups.",
        "however, only 4 days later, anteguera, the former leader of the union of communist youth, was killed at bogota airport.",
        "senator ernesto pisano, one of the liberal party candidates for the presidency, was seriously injured at the same time.",
        "many members of the military were present at the airport on that day, as well as the police chief of the capital, yet only one of the murderers was killed, while the rest escaped.",
        "this is why we told president barco that we had serious doubts about the army's role in this assassination.",
        "next year, presidential elections and elections of the legislative bodies are due to take place in colombia.",

        "barco added that drug trafficking cartels have to know that they are not just struggling against colombia, because \"the whole world is united in its indignation and in its solidarity with the actions we are currently carrying out.\"",
        "virgilio barco said drug trafficking is \"a criminal enterprise that is being nurtured by the habits of millions of cocaine consumers, some of whom are probably listening.\" \"",
        "those who depend on cocaine have permitted the appearance of the most violent criminal organization that the world has known,\" the president stated. \"",
        "what initially seemed a matter of personal habits has had explosive consequences for society,\" he added.",
        "barco warned the international community: \"naturally, it is more important for you to reduce the demand than for us to reduce the offer.",
        "we cannot fully destroy drug trafficking while it is capable of achieving extraordinary profits and while there are thousands of persons who consume illegal drugs somewhere, in some country.\"",

        "nevertheless, the diplomats say that there is no evidence to back such speculation and they add that it is very likely that several interests are working to destabilize the country's fragile democracy. \"",
        "it seems as if several strings are being pulled at the same time,\" a diplomat said.",
        "while christian democratic president vinicio cerezo has given guatemala a respite, after decades of military regimes during which it is believed that more than 100,000 people were killed as a result of political violence, it is estimated that approximately 1,200 leftist guerrillas are still fighting in the mountains.",
        "furthermore, the country has faced two coup attempts since democracy was restored in 1986.",
        "the ultra-right-wing, with its ties to the land-owning oligarchy, continues to be a powerful force in the country.",
        "it has blocked a majority of reforms that cerezo has tried to introduce and, according to the general consensus, it has promoted discontent among the armed forces' mid-level officers. \"",
        "the ultra-right-wing is undoubtedly behind part of the violence,\" said a diplomat. \"",
        "it could be trying to force the government to overreact or cause the army to get involved.\"",
        "as if to confirm this, a police arrest warrant has been issued against former presidential candidate lionel sisniega, a noted politician who leans to the right and has been involved in coup attempts since 1954, on charges of heading a group responsible for much of the violence in the country.",
        "diplomats have also pointed to the resurgence of activities by left-wing guerrillas who have been struggling to topple successive governments over the past 2 decades. \"",
        "nowadays they are using much more obvious tactics, erecting barricades on highways and occupying small towns near the capital,\" one diplomat said.",
        "fear that the violence of the seventies will return may also contribute toward a resurgence in the number of illegal immigrants that cross over to mexico.",
        "mexican authorities say that the number of undocumented central americans deported to guatemala has doubled over the past few months.",
        "the diplomats feel that cerezo's government will weather the violence and pass it onto his successor after the presidential elections scheduled for november 1990. \"",
        "perhaps the situation is the result of the preparation for elections in guatemala,\" a diplomat said. \"",
        "things will probably worsen next year.\""

        "(assaf) the official reports on the regrettable case in arboledas at noon today, and those carried by rcn and other stations, describing the way in which mayor pedro jesus hernandez was murdered while inaugurating a dining hall for children at juan bueno, arboledas municipality, lead us to believe that something extremely serious is happening.",
        "hernandez was going to inaugurate on 20-25 february four or five works that are important for the development of the communities and had been demanded by them for a long time.",
        "this leads us to believe that the situation is really difficult and that other measures will have to be adopted to prevent a continuation of these regrettable actions, which destabilize public order in the department.",
        "i think that after the peace talks with m-19 (19 april movement) are concluded next week, dr. octavio pardo should in some way promote a truce with the national liberation army (eln) and the epl (popular liberation army) to see if it is possible to begin a dialogue and keep the bloodshed from continuing in our country, most particularly in our department.",
        "over the course of a month, two mayors, who were characterized as the fightingest mayors -- in the sense that they launched, executed, and completed works -- have been killed in our department.",
        "(reporter) mr. governor, how many mayors did you say have been killed during that time?",
        "(assaf) what did you say?",
        "(repoerter) mr. governor, do you believe that, for instance, civic or political leaders in the area of north santander can participate in talks with the epl and the eln to make serious proposals to the government about a possible truce, as you suggest?",
        "(assaf) in view of our current situation, that is, in view of the fact that a month ago the mayor of abrego was killed and the arboledas mayor was killed yesterday, i believe that the country is pleased that the pacification process with m-19 will end this week.",
        "so, why not look for avenues of communication with the (1-second break in reception) and the epl to establish a truce, at least during this electoral period, so that all colombians, especially those of north santander, can freely exercise their sovereign right to participate in an election and express their satisfaction with or condemnation of the people who are currently governing the municipalities?",

        "he said these measures were necessary for the country's economy, which was affected last year, first, by the overall cuts in u.s. aid to the region, a reduction of $55 million for el salvador; second, by the drop in international coffee prices, which caused $150 million in losses for el salvador; and third, by the damage from the guerrilla offensive in november.",
        "before leaving on his trip and in response to newsmen's questions, president cristiani also defended the armed forces, stating that the actions in which they have been involved recently have not weakened them and, on the contrary, have strengthened the armed forces because errors have been admitted and those responsible are being prosecuted, such as in the cases of the jesuits and the civilians who were killed on 11 february in chalatenango.",
        "cristiani said that in the latter case there have been no pressures and that from the moment that there was news about the tragedy, the commission that investigates criminal acts was ordered to undertake the appropriate investigation to determine the cause of the tragedy.",
        "he said it concluded that the tragedy was caused by a helicopter rocket, but there was no bombing, although the civilians were victims of war actions.",
        "cristiani criticized the fmln for waging battles in populated areas because this endangers civilians.",
        "in conclusion, cristiani said the fmln will never give up its attempts to weaken or divide the armed forces, but he added that the armed forces are becoming more professional every day."

        "a century later cartagena was occupied by the french.",
        "finally, in 1741, the city's defenders successfully fought off an assault by a host of 27,000 pirates headed by sir edward vernon... the western press described the meeting between the presidents of the united states, bolivia, colombia, and peru held a few days ago in cartagena as a kind of assault.",
        "despite some exaggeration, this graphic description was based on perfectly serious grounds.",
        "after all, the conference did discuss immediate tasks and even a detailed schedule for a joint offensive by the governments of these countries against criminal drug trafficking, which ranks first in the pecking order of crime.",
        "it is indeed necessary to launch an assault against the drug mafia's strongholds, whether in medellin, \"famous\" for unbridled gangsterism, or in cartagena itself, whose status as a resort is threatened by the selfsame \"cocaine barons.\"",
        "as a matter of fact, this tourist center has been repeatedly shaken in recent months by the explosions of bombs planted by terrorists in the \"hilton\" hotel, in stores, or at its marinas.",
        "it is no wonder, as reuter reports, that not a single cruise ship has dropped anchor there this season.",
        "yes, the situation is highly alarming, and this applies to the whole of colombia and even to the entire region.",
        "in these conditions the firm resolve displayed by the participants in the cartagena meeting deserves understanding and support: the resolve to finally pool their efforts in the struggle against organized crime and to jointly place a reliable barrier in its path.",
        "these are the intentions shown in the joint statement signed by the four presidents and by the series of special documents.",
        "the aim of these agreements is noble indeed: to besiege the drug mafia in its nests, to cut off the \"laundering\" of drug dollars, and to deprive the merchants of \"slow death\" of broad access to the \"black market\" in the united states, where, as a matter of fact, the lion's share of south america's poisonous export is consumed.",
        "in other words, an important step has been taken to combat one of the main \"evils of the 20th century,\" and it was not for nothing that the meeting's results were positively appraised by un secretary general j. perez de cuellar.",
        "here is a different question: emphasis in cartagena was placed on administrative and police measures and on washington's primarily militarized forms of cooperation with the andean states, but does this conform with their long-term national interests, with their desire to put an end to backwardness and attain a qualitatively new level of socioeconomic development?",
        "after all, a radical solution of the drug problem primarily demands neither combat aircraft not armored personnel carriers, but something quite different.",
        "it is necessary to change the economic profile of vast provinces where the cultivation of coca and marijuana is the sole source of the population's existence.",
        "true enough, the united states has now expressed readiness to assist also in this sphere.",
        "on the other hand, there is an almost total lack of readiness to import from south america the crops which could, in principle, squeeze out coca and marijuana.",
        "it was not for nothing that colombia's president virgilio barco, the white house's closest ally in the struggle against drugs, was forced to declare in cartagena that the u.s. government's rigid protectionist measures are jeopardizing the very future of \"alternative\" sectors of tropical crop farming -- the cultivation of coffee, flowers, and sugar cane.",
        "and so the \"senior partner\" appears to be tightening with the one hand the vise in which the drug mafia now finds itself, while using the other hand to protect its market from legal latin american exports.",
        "finally, the last but, i think, most substantive argument.",
        "actually, it also casts an unfavorable light on the role of consistent fighter against the drug mafia which washington has now assumed.",
        "this argument is perfectly encapsulated in just one short word: \"panama.\"",
        "indeed, did the recent aggression against this sovereign state, one of whose main motives was actually \"to punish the drug business bosses,\" not demonstrate all the flaws of washington's \"strongarm approach\" toward latin america?",
        "and are there any guarantees that the pentagon will not start \"copying\" its panamanian experience in other countries in the continent on the pretext of pursuing the \"cocaine barons\"?",
        "these are far from rhetorical questions, and it is a pity that cartagena simply failed to provide even the slightest clear-cut answers to them."

        "we must not rule out the possibility that the salvadoran terrorists might promote terrorist actions before the sandinists relinquish power in order to create a climate of antagonism against the new government in managua and demonstrate that they have strength,\" the military officer said.",
        "according to the salvadoran armed forces, the arms shipment seized by honduran authorities on saturday consists of 24 ak-47 rifles, 24 handles and 76 clips for those weapons, 80 rolls of \"slow fuse\" weighing over 2 kg each, and a \"large quantity of materials to manufacture explosives.\"",
        "the military material was being carried in a truck by salvadorans victor emilio dubon and feliciano garcia, who \"were part of logistics unit,\" of the fmln, according to a press communique released by the armed forces press committee (coprefa) today.",

        "on 8 april, another \"large quantiity of medicine and surgical supplies\" was seized in the honduran department of copan, where the arms cargo had been discovered the day before, coprefa reported. \"",
        "the salvadoran armed forces again call on citizens to report all sorts of suspicious activities that may be carried out in their communities and thus avert possible terrorist actions by the fmln,\" coprefa said in a commnique released tonight.",
        "the charges regarding the seizure of weapons and medicine have been raised at a time when the government and the fmln are preparing to resume the process of dialogue under un sponsorship, probably early next month.",
