(reporter) (words indistinct) commander, when do you expect the fmln to join the process? (handal) look, deadlines are not the most important thing right now. what is important now is complying with the agreements to reach political agreements. that is the main aspect of the geneva agreement. it is possible that some deadlines will not be met. if deadlines are set and the time for implementing them expires, then this is tantamount to wasting time. this then leads to steps being demanded that in reality depend on the political agreements that are reached and not the deadlines for reaching them. therefore, according to the agenda and the timetable agreed to here in caracas, the accent is on the political agreements. those agreements have to do with changes within the armed forces. everything related to the armed forces must be changed. every factor concerning the armed forces must be reviewed from a certain point or perspective. changes are necessary; changes must be made and those changes must be significant. these changes must completely transform the armed forces, beginning with its role and influence in determining the country's policies and guidelines. we have been presenting proposals in this regard for some time. the topic of democratization is closely linked to the topic of the armed forces, to its purging, its reduction, and in sum, its end. we believe that the country will not always need the armed forces. as with any institution or historical factor, it emerges, it is maintained for a certain time, and then it tends to disappear. the country must have the opportunity to develop. it cannot continue along the same path because this would only represent expenses and a heavy burden for the country. for several decades, the armed forces have meant absence of liberty, real security, and the impossibility of the civilian society to decide the country's path. elections have been turned into a mere formality, where those who were not elected run the country. the country is now going through a drama that has also shocked the international public, the murder of the jesuit priests. everyone is awaiting the results of the investigations and hoping that those who were responsible for this crime will be punished. we believe that the case of jesuit priests is really grave; it is a drama that reflects the drama of the salvadoran people's history in the current century.
