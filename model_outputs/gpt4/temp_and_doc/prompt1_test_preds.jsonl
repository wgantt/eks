(unidentified speaker) in fact, she and several das inspectors encountered some obstacles. the attorney general's office was informed of these obstacles in order for it to make an investigation. i think that when she and the das personnel were preparing to go to puerto boyaca it was already known that these people would be present there for these proceedings and this was quite worrisome. (corrales) as is known, judge gonzalez had to leave colombia because her life was threatened, and her father, former boyaca governor alvaro gonzalez santana, was subsequently murdered. moreover, gen maza marquez said further that the fact that a payment is being offered for the capture of pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha does not mean that other persons accused of being capos of the mafia are not being sought too. (maza) we are taking action the length and breadth of the country. we are not showing any special considerations because we intend to act indiscriminately. what we want is to fight a scourge that has greatly harmed all colombians. (corrales) the das director said that if anyone being held in connection with the investigation of the killing of luis carlos galan is released, that does not mean that the investigations are not proceeding well.
